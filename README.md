# Pokédex

## Introduction 
The goal of this project was to become familiar with the Retrofit2 library. For this, I decided to use an open-source API, because creating my own API would be a challenge of its own. After some research, I decided to use the PokéAPI and develop a Pokédex (in the Pokémon world a device used to store and catalog information about the various Pokémon species) app.
